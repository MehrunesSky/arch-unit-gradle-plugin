## [1.0.2] - 2019-11-16

### Fixed
 - we can now define a configurableRule with no check : all of them will be executed by default
 - classes to load now have better chances to be found (using a Gradle specific scope path provider)

## [1.0.1] - 2019-11-11

### Fixed
 - Setting a default empty list for preconfiguredRules and configurableRules to avoid NPE later on in case one is not defined through plugin config

### First version !
